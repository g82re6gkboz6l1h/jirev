# Why Cloud-Native Development Is the New Standard

Modern applications are no longer built for a single server. Cloud-native development focuses on scalability, resilience, and automation.

## Key Concepts

- Containers (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Microservices architecture
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Benefits

- Faster deployment cycles
- High availability
- Cost efficiency
- Easier scaling

## Industry Impact

Companies adopting cloud-native approaches release features faster and respond better to market changes.
